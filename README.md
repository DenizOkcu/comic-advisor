## Coding Challenge

### The Idea
The purpose of this challenge is to give us an idea about your coding skills.

At XING we value well structured and tested code. Semantic HTML, modern and responsive CSS, a consistent coding style and a structured workflow are important to us.

### Challenge
You build a ReactJS application which contains a list and a detail view of eg. messages, a to-do-list, bookmarked articles.
Start with `create-react-app`(https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Please do the layout and styling with your own css. Don't use any component libraries like bootstrap or material-ui.

- Total working time should not be more than 6 hours
- Please don't use something you already developed
- Document your code (see below)
- Please use separate branches for part 1 and part 2

#### Task - Part 1
In this task we like to see how you write your frontend code. Keep it simple and don't use any external API. You can iterate on that feature in the second part of the coding challenge. 
The application should be somewhat pleasant to look at and responsive.

1. Create a page with two sections.
2. In one section you have a list of items (min. 2 items) with a little preview of the content.
3. In the other section there's a detail view of the selected item.
4. When you click on one of the items in the list, the content is shown in the other section.
5. Use your own mock data.

This is the base for the second part.

#### Task - Part 2
It's your turn now! Show off your coding skills and extend the application. 
Come up with your own idea or take some inspiration from these examples:

- CSS animations
- filter functionality for the list view
- mark an item as read
- data manipulation
- use a public API instead of mock data (eg. https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
- Add more pages by using routes
- fully accessible with tabs and screen readers
- etc.

### Notes
- We'd like to see how familiar you're with React and React features. 
- If you think you'll need another framework please explain shortly in the documentation section.
- Testing your code is important, we'd like to see some tests (full coverage not required).

### Documentation
Use this readme to document what you've built. 
Make sure that the person that reviews this code understands your choices and limitations.

- Describe what you've built. A screenshot is always nice.
- Commit messages are also some kind of documentation.
- Outline your reasoning behind technical choices (architecture, third party libs, React features, etc.)
- Explain technical trade-offs
- Anything you skipped due to time constraint?
- What would you add if you had additional time for this project?

Happy coding & good luck! ðŸš€
